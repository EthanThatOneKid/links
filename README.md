> An app for link collectors

## Development 👨‍💻

This project is powered by [Svelte][svelte] and utilizes [cutting-edge][web_dev] browser APIs.

To get started, clone this repository, run `npm i` to install the dependencies, and then run `npm run dev` to spin up the [development server][localhost].

## Features 💅
