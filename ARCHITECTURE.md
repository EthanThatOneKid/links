# Architecture

## Features

This project is a [PWA (Progressive Web Application)][pwa] utility for storing, categorizing, and looking up links to other websites.
Each link to a website is stored locally as a collection with the [IndexDB Web API][idb] (with help from [Dexie.js][storage_lib] [ðŸ’¡][dexie.js_example]).
Various file formats (PNG, GIF, JSON) will be acceptable for a lively drag-n-drop user experience.
The web application will work with all of these offline and as an installed PWA.

## [`manifest.json`](manifest.json)

The [`manifest.json`](manifest.json) file is responsible for orchestrating all of the information and assets needed for this project to be a valid PWA.
